    <center><h4>Our Roots In Kindness (Origin Story)</h4>
    <p> Kindness is at the heart of everything we do – but – we’re about so much more. With the aim of creating skincare that is fuss-free and approachable, we’re committed to keeping you and your skin looking (and feeling!) its best, starting with clean, uncomplicated products that downright love your skin and the planet too.</p>
</center>
<center><h4>Clean Beauty Is Simple</h4>
    <p> What is clean beauty? A concept so simple, has now become so complicated. People have a lot of questions. How do I know if a brand follows clean beauty? Does natural mean clean beauty? What exactly are the ingredients to look for? And many more! But is clean beauty really that complicated? Moreover, does it NEED to be that complicated? NO! Clean Beauty Is Simple! </p>
</center>

<center><h4>Kind To Skin</h4>
    <p>It’s no secret that we’re crazy about skin lovin’ ingredients! What we leave out of our products is just as important as what we put in them! In fact we only seek out ingredients that respect your skin’s natural ecosystem.  This is why, when an ingredient is harsh it doesn’t go anywhere near our products, and gets added to our NOs list! You can always trust that our skincare will always be gentle and effective even on the most sensitive skin.</p>
